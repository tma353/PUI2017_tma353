Task 2:
Some time series are stationary, some have a complex structure, some show a downward trend: Identify the ridership types that have steadily increased in popularity, 
and that have steadily decreased. by how much? (e.g what is the ratio of usage in the first 10 and last 10 weeks)
Task 3:
Several stations show a prominent annual periodicity. 
Identify the 4 stations (indentify them by the index of their location in the data cube) that show the most prominent periodic trend on an annual period (52 weeks). (Can you figure out what the periodic peak in rides is due to?)
