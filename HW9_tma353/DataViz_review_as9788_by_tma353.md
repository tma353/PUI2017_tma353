Peer review of Data Viz for coffee1league

![](solar_nycha_data_map.png)

CLARITY:

The plot has the description in the markdown file and not on the figure itself. A scale or legend on the plot would be convienent to make it more clear. The quantity is not clear and unit of measure would be helpful to understand the amount of the values shown to relate it to the size of the icon on the map.

ESTHETIC:

The esthetic is functional in that a map of NYC is useful to display availble roof top solar area. The colors are a blue gradient and are reasonable. Once again a legend on the map to explain the units.

HONESTY:

The plot appears honet in representing information. However, without units of measure to contextualize the space represented by the blue gradient icon and compare to the NYC landmass, it is difficult to determine.
