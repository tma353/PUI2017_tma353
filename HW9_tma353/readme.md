HW 9_2

Worked with Matt and somewhat with Sarah and Alex. 

The Assigmnment was focused on geospatial data and using Census information about internet access combined with Wifi data from a company called LinkNYC. The data cleansing and merging was a substantial part of the early parts and later was focused on mapping the availibilty of wifi from the two major data sources. The materials from the assignment repo and the Lab9 notebook from Chris Prince was very useful to understand the methods of using geopandas.
